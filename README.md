# Movie App
Deployed: 

This project is a movie catalog with login.
 The catalog has the following features:

* Next.js 14, React
* Authentication with Firebase
* Favorites list
* Indexed by search engines
* Responsive
* Type checking with Typescript

## Technologies Used

* Next.js 14 was chosen because it is a relatively new framework that includes new features and changes. Although I had worked with Next.js before, this new version changes a lot and presented an important opportunity for me to learn and update.
* Sass was chosen because of my previous experience with this preprocessor, which allowed me to quickly tackle the design and responsive part.
* The themoviedb API was chosen because the facility to get the movies and poster data.
* React Context
* Deployed with Vercel
